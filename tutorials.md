I spent some time teaching coding at the undergraduate level (primarily in VBA and R).  I used the following lessons to give an introduction to R:


* [Lesson 1](https://dmbeskow.github.io/html/Lesson1.html)
* [Lesson 2](https://dmbeskow.github.io/html/Lesson2.html)
* [Lesson 3](https://dmbeskow.github.io/html/Lesson3.html)
* [Lesson 4](https://dmbeskow.github.io/html/Lesson4.html)

I used the following tutorials to teach students how to conduct basic monte carlo simulation in R:

* [Monte Carlo Lesson 1](https://dmbeskow.github.io/html/MonteCarloR1.html)
* [Monte Carlo Lesson 2](https://dmbeskow.github.io/html/MonteCarloR2.html)
