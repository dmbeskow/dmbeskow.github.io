A week or so ago I shared a blog demonstrating how to download reputable
COVID-19 data and generate temporal Coronavirus case count plots like
the ones seen in top news sites such as the New York Times or Wall
Street Journal. This week I will walk through how to use that same data
from last week and the R programming language to generate a choropleth
plot by county in the United States.

The plots that I will generate are all static plots. If you want to see
an interactive example, I would refer you to a great tool that Ian Kloo
created at <https://iankloo.github.io/cov_map/>.

National Level Choropleth Maps
------------------------------

Let’s start by getting the same county level data we downloaded in the
last post.

``` r
require(ggplot2)
require(readr)
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(lubridate)
require(knitr)

download.file('https://usafactsstatic.blob.core.windows.net/public/data/covid-19/covid_confirmed_usafacts.csv', 'covid_confirmed_usafacts.csv')
```

Now let’s convert it from wide to long format.

``` r
county =  read_csv('covid_confirmed_usafacts.csv', col_types = cols(countyFIPS = 'c'))
county_long <- gather(county, date, count, 5:ncol(county))
names(county_long) <- c('fips','county','state','state_fips','date','count')
county_long$date <- mdy(county_long$date)
kable(head(county_long))
```

| fips | county                | state |  state\_fips| date       |  count|
|:-----|:----------------------|:------|------------:|:-----------|------:|
| 0    | Statewide Unallocated | AL    |            1| 2020-01-22 |      0|
| 1001 | Autauga County        | AL    |            1| 2020-01-22 |      0|
| 1003 | Baldwin County        | AL    |            1| 2020-01-22 |      0|
| 1005 | Barbour County        | AL    |            1| 2020-01-22 |      0|
| 1007 | Bibb County           | AL    |            1| 2020-01-22 |      0|
| 1009 | Blount County         | AL    |            1| 2020-01-22 |      0|

Now we’ll summarize all counts by county. The only data we won’t count
is counts that are labeled *Statewide Unallocated*. This is presumably
state level counts that were never attributed to a distinct county.

``` r
cty <- county_long %>%
  group_by(fips, county, state, county) %>%
  summarize(count = max(count)) %>%
  filter(count > 0) %>%
  filter(county != 'Statewide Unallocated')
```

Looking at the data, we will see that R cut off some of the FIPS code
leading zeros. The code below will concatenate a leading ‘0’ to the
front of any FIPS code with only 4 digits.

``` r
x <- nchar(cty$fips)
cty$fips[x == 4] <- paste0('0',cty$fips[x == 4] )
kable(head(cty))
```

| fips  | county                             | state |  count|
|:------|:-----------------------------------|:------|------:|
| 1     | New York City Unallocated/Probable | NY    |    119|
| 10001 | Kent County                        | DE    |    793|
| 10003 | New Castle County                  | DE    |   1864|
| 10005 | Sussex County                      | DE    |   2359|
| 01001 | Autauga County                     | AL    |     45|
| 01003 | Baldwin County                     | AL    |    181|

The `usmap` library in R provides a great resource for easily merging
and visualizing county and state level data. The simplicity of this is
demonstrated in the single line of code below:

``` r
library(usmap)

df <- countypop %>% dplyr::left_join(cty, by = 'fips')
kable(head(df))
```

| fips  | abbr | county.x       |  pop\_2015| county.y       | state |  count|
|:------|:-----|:---------------|----------:|:---------------|:------|------:|
| 01001 | AL   | Autauga County |      55347| Autauga County | AL    |     45|
| 01003 | AL   | Baldwin County |     203709| Baldwin County | AL    |    181|
| 01005 | AL   | Barbour County |      26489| Barbour County | AL    |     43|
| 01007 | AL   | Bibb County    |      22583| Bibb County    | AL    |     42|
| 01009 | AL   | Blount County  |      57673| Blount County  | AL    |     40|
| 01011 | AL   | Bullock County |      10696| Bullock County | AL    |     14|

Now we’ll visualize the lower 48 states as a county level choropleth
plot:

``` r
plot_usmap(data = df, values = "count", color = 'white') +
  scale_fill_continuous(
    low = "orange", high = "red", name = "Count", label = scales::comma) +
  theme(legend.position = "right",panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black",
                                                                 colour = "black",
                                                                 size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  ggtitle('Number of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases by County')
```

This map is hard to decipher because the magnitude of the COVID-19
epidemic in the greater New York City area simply dwarfs everything
else. On the Choropleth map, this means that NYC is red, and everything
else is simply orange. The easiest way to fix this is to use a type of
logarithmic scale for the coloration. This is done below:

``` r
my_breaks = c(0, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000)
plot_usmap(data = df, values = "count", color = 'white') +
  scale_fill_continuous(
    low = "orange", high = "red", name = "Count", trans = "log", breaks = my_breaks, label = scales::comma) +
  theme(legend.position = "right",panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black",
                                                                 colour = "black",
                                                                 size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  ggtitle('Number of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases by County')
```

The choropleth on a logarithmic gradient scale reveals the regional
hotspots that were originally hidden by the national hotspots.

Finally, I’d like to highlight that most choropleths are statistically
deceiving, given that most choropleth maps (including these) are
comparing geography representing vastly different areas and populations.
One way to fix this is to use arbitrary square geometry of equal size
instead of the current county geometry. Another way to fix this is to
simply normalize our county level data by the county population. The
hotspots on the new map are the areas that have a high COVID-19 Case
count relative to their population. The count metric in this case is
count per 100,000 people

``` r
df$count_per_100K <- 100000 * df$count/df$pop_2015

my_breaks = c(0, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000)
plot_usmap(data = df, values = "count_per_100K", color = 'white') +
  scale_fill_continuous(
    low = "orange", high = "red", name = "Count per 100K", trans = "log", breaks = my_breaks, label = scales::comma) +
  theme(legend.position = "right",panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black",
                                                                 colour = "black",
                                                                 size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  ggtitle('Number of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases by County')
```

State Level Choropleth Maps
---------------------------

Now we’ll use the raw count choropleth at the state level. The `usmap`
library makes this easy with only slight changes to the code we
presented above. Given that I’m currently residing in Pittsburgh, let’s
take a look a Pennsylvania.

``` r
plot_usmap(data = df, values = "count", color = 'white', include = c('PA')) +
  scale_fill_continuous(
    low = "orange", high = "red", name = "Count", trans = "log", breaks = my_breaks,label = scales::comma) +
  theme(legend.position = "right",panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black",
                                                                  colour = "black",
                                                                  size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  ggtitle('Number of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases by County')
```

![](https://dmbeskow.github.io/images/2020-04-15-virus2/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

Now let’s take a look at PA normalized by population (counts per 100K)
using the logarithmic density scale introduced above. Now we get to see
some adjustment of the map when we normalize it by the county
population.

``` r
plot_usmap(data = df, values = "count_per_100K", color = 'white', include = c('PA')) +
  scale_fill_continuous(
    low = "orange", high = "red", name = "Count per 100K", trans = "log", breaks = my_breaks,label = scales::comma) +
  theme(legend.position = "right",panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black",
                                                                  colour = "black",
                                                                  size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  ggtitle('Number of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases by County')
```

Regional Level Choropleth Map
-----------------------------

And if we want to see a region, we just add a few more states to the
`include` vector:

``` r
plot_usmap(data = df, values = "count_per_100K", color = 'white', include = c('PA', 'NY','NJ')) +
  scale_fill_continuous(
    low = "orange", high = "red", name = "Count per 100K", trans = "log", breaks = my_breaks,label = scales::comma) +
  theme(legend.position = "right",panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black",
                                                                  colour = "black",
                                                                  size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  ggtitle('Number of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases by County')
```

Choropleths can be a powerful method of visualizing the spatial
distribution of an underlying event or phenomena. In this case we used
them to view and understand the spatial nature of COVID-19 cases in the
United States. The power of interactive plots like the one used by Ian
Kloo at <https://iankloo.github.io/cov_map/> is that they can
simultaneously model the spatial and the temporal density of data.
