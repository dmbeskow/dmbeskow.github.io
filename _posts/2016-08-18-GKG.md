title:  "GKG Analysis to Identify Influential Individuals"
categories: [R]
tags: [spatial]
---

The [Global Knowledge Graph](http://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-global-knowledge-graph/), related to the [Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone](http://gdeltproject.org), provides a very rich dataset with many potential use cases. In this blog I will illustrate how we used it to identify influencers in a national or regional network. This algorithm feeds a Shiny WebApp located [here](http://data-analytics.net/Apps/fusionNet/). The basic idea of this algorithm is to subset 30 days of GKG data based on regions (we
found that national capitals worked best), build a network of the people in this subset (based on co-mentions), and then to run network centrality algorithms against this network to order the data based on influence. The top influencers on this list are then fused with Wikipedia data in order to provide a two sentence description.
